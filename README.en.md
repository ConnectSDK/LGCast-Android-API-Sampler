# LGCast SDK Sampler App for Android

LG Cast is an additional feature provided by Connect SDK's WebOS TV Service.
It provides screen sharing between mobile apps and LG TVs in a home network environment.

There are two ways to cast the screen on the TV;

+ Screen mirroring - Displays the entire app screen on TV. 
+ Dual screen - Creates second screen separate from app, and displays it on TV.
